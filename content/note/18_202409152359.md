Alt Tab does not work on Ubuntu 22.04
1. When I press Alt Tab on Ubuntu 22.04, I can switch between windows.
2. However, the cursor is not activated in the newly selected window.
3. As a result, when I need to do more than just view the window after pressing Alt Tab, I have to click with the mouse to selected window.
