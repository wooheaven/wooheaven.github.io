The Essence of **"Understanding Architecture"**

I think the phrase "Understanding Architecture" holds a lot of meaning.  
Let's break it down.

1. **Efficient Construction:** **Life is Choice** bewteen Birth and Death.  
I can manage and supervise all aspects of a construction project  
in a manner that maximizes productivity minimizes waste,  
and ensures that the project will be completed on time on quality and within budget.  
Efficiency is not made by a silver-bullet  
but through trade-offs with endless **dicision-makings**.  
  
2. **Stable Maintenance:** Please **don't stop the whole world.**   
For example When a leak happen, I can not only repairing the leak  
but also detecting hazardous areas and preserving other areas without problems.
