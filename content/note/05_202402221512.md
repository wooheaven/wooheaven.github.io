Let's break it down.

1. **Efficient Construction:** **Life is Choice** bewteen Birth and Death.

and ensures that the project will be completed on time on quality and within budget.  
Efficiency is not made by a silver-bullet  
but through trade-offs with endless **Dicision-makings**.  
  
2. **Stable Maintenance:** **Don't stop the whole world.**

but also detecting hazardous areas and preserving other areas without problems.  
Finally, guarantee **Everything will be fine.**
